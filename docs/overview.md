# Hotel Intel — Product Overview

## Vision

Hotel Intel transforms how luxury and palace hotels understand their operations and their guests. Instead of managers manually pulling numbers from a dozen disconnected systems, an AI-powered pipeline collects operational data overnight and delivers polished, actionable intelligence before the first coffee is poured.

Hotel Intel is built around two core modules:

1. **Daily Recap** — An AI-generated morning briefing with KPIs, arrivals, incidents, and action items
2. **Guest Intelligence** — Cross-system guest matching and profiling that builds a complete picture of every guest from fragmented data across all hotel systems

## The Problem

Luxury hotels run on 10–15+ software systems that don't talk to each other. Every morning, department heads spend 30–60 minutes hunting through Oracle OPERA, spa platforms, F&B tools, incident logs, and finance systems to piece together yesterday's picture. The result is often incomplete, late, or both.

General managers receive fragmented updates — if they receive them at all. Critical patterns (VIP arrivals coinciding with understaffing, revenue dips, recurring incidents) go unnoticed until it's too late.

**The guest data problem is even worse.** A returning guest's spa preferences live in TAC, their dining history in 7rooms, their complaints in Unifocus, and their concierge requests in yet another system. When that guest arrives, staff have no unified view — leading to missed personalization opportunities and repeated mistakes.

## The Solution

Hotel Intel is a SaaS product that:

1. **Connects** to the hotel's existing tech stack via APIs and secure integrations
2. **Aggregates** operational, financial, and guest data from all sources
3. **Generates** an AI-powered daily intelligence recap — clear, concise, prioritized
4. **Builds unified guest profiles** by matching identities across all systems
5. **Delivers arrival briefs** so staff know every guest's history, preferences, and special needs before they walk in
6. **Delivers** recaps and alerts via email, Telegram, and a web dashboard

No new software for staff to learn. No manual data entry. Just signal, not noise.
